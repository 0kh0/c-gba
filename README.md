# How to make your own fork?
1. click fork
2. Settings --> pages --> set up github pages
3. All gba games should work out of the box! 
NES Games are hosted on a remote server by us, and it's a bit trickier to just upload a list of them so upon request we can distrubute, otherwise when forking they will still reference our server.



# GBA Games
GBA Emulator hosted on my account.
More games added by me, and other design changes by me.
Also more games by Nailington
